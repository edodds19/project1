 KIEI-451 Assignment #1: Classic Cocktail Quarantine

https://edodds19-project1.netlify.app/

Some of the things I've done while in quarantine have been fairly productive and/or useful (recruiting, reading, elaborate cooking, binging bad shows on Netflix), while others—one in particular—have been somewhat less so. This is an homage to that particular less productive skill I've been honing of late: amateur bartending.
This is a hobby I've had for a while, but have been spending more time with as of late, and rather enjoying it. I'm a big old fashioned (most spirit-forward drinks, really) fan and have been trying out new recipes at least a few times a week. 
I've also hosted the occasional "speakeasy night" for friends, so I figure this could be a good jumping-off point to see whether I want to continue that post-graduation while also putting together a website that highlights what I've been doing of late.
Ultimately, the goal would to build this out into a full site, with categories broken down by spirit.
I hope you enjoy it!
